# Plastic Regrind Color Sort

This is a project for automating the sorting process of plastic regrind by color with the intent of aiding the recycling of failed 3D prints and filament change purge into new filament.  This is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi in order to drive the computer vision algorithm whilst also providing GPIO pins for the electronics.

Currently, only the CV portion has been completed.  The hardware portion is still in the works.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi
- A webcam or better
- A solid background (neutral gray preferred)
- A 3D printer (eventually)
- More TBD

## Authoring Disclaimer

As this is a hobby project and I am not all that familiar with computer vision, let alone OpenCV, sadly the majority of code is written by ChatGPT.  I don't like the idea of using AI, let alone using it so heavily to write project code, but it did speed up the process to where I had a working version in a couple of hours, versus what might have been a couple of days or weeks.
